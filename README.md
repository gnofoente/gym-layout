# GymPass

## Description
This project is a direct reproduction of the .png layout provided by GymPass. It was coded in pure HTML + CSS and mostly pure JS (jQuery is used for the carousel slider and some viewport size querying). 

The CSS approach was mobile-first, looking to style firstly for smaller screens. 

The BEM methodology (https://en.bem.info/methodology/) was used for class naming purposes.

No CSS/JS frameworks were used. The main reason is that such kind of technology **was not** needed to deliver the final outcome, so using frameworks/other technologies would be overcomplicating.
